1)problem:
methods and datas: possibly will have many conflicts
[1] pry(main)> groucho = {
[1] pry(main)*   :name => "groucho",
[1] pry(main)* }
=> {:name=>"groucho"}
[2] pry(main)> def plays(brother)
[2] pry(main)*   "my name is #{brother[:name]}"
[2] pry(main)* end
=> :plays
[3] pry(main)> plays(groucho)
=> "my name is groucho"


1)solution:
object and classes which you have just one method and one data.


2) superclass (heritance)
harpo.class.ancestors

# open classes

"some string".hotdogs
=> undefined

--- Create a class:
class BasicObject
  def hotdogs
    "hotdogs" * 40
  end
end

:hotdogs
=> "some string"
