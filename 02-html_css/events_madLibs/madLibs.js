// Exercises: Events
// Mad Libs
// Start with this webpage, which has several input elements and a button:
// Create a new Javascript file and link to it with a script tag at the bottom.
// Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
// In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
