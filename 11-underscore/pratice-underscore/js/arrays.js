// Arrays!
// Log out the answers to all of the following questions!

// Here is some data that you can work with.

// var numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
// var bumpyArr = ["hello", "maytag", [[[["sigmonster"]], "swizzle"]]];
// var uncompactedArr = [ "hello", false, NaN, undefined, "quantom bogo-sort" ];

// var arrToTransform = [[ "age", "location" ], [ NaN, undefined ]];
// Create an array of every five numbers between 30 and 101
// Turn bumpyArr into one flat array (no nested arrays)
// Remove all of the falsey elements in the uncompactedArr
// Find all of the unique elements in the following arrays - [ 1, 25, 100 ], [ 1, 14, 25 ] and 24, Infinity, -0
// Find the index of the first element in numbers that is over 7 and is even
// Turn arrToTransform into an object that looks like this - { age: NaN, location: undefined }
